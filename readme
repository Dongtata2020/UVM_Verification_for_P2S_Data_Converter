This is a mini project for UVM verification project which will take you up to three days and it is suitable for inexperienced verification engineers.

You will understand the basic composition and operating mechanism of the UVM verification environment through this project.


In order to learn about UVM verification, you need to try actual projects. 
As a beginner, it is difficult to access the actual project,so I selected a simple design from the book "Verilog Digital System Design Tutorial" by Xia Yuwen as the DUT.
And i wrote UVM verification Environment around it to take the first step towards independent verification.

The design files include out16hi.v ptosda.v and top.v.
Tb file is tb.sv.
Sim files include dt_pkg.sv m1_pkg.sv and m2_pkg.sv.
My simulation software is QuestaSim 10.6c.
There is a TCL script file named run.do for easier operation,so you can enter commands "do run.do" in the software to run the simulation quickly.
Of corese you should compile all the file before doing this opration.

More details are in file readme.docx.
